# Countdown-Timer-Repo
Repository for creative coding challenge 
<h1>What This Is</h1>
<p>The Code included is what I wrote for a coding challenge, specifically being to create a count down timer</p>
<h2>What It Does</h2>
<p>This timer runs inside of a browser.<br>The program allows for a user to input a desired time in seconds which is then displayed
as a timer in minutes and seconds as it counts down immideatly in one second intervals.<br>The program correctly convers seconds to minutes
when inputing a time and correctly remoes minutes and adds seconds when at the end of a minute interval 
<strong>(ex. 01:00 -> 00:59)</strong>.<br>Aswell the program properly stops once the time runs out and it displays the message 
"Your Timer is done".</p>
